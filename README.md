# asset-db-frontend
I have a lot of game assets, some from the unreal engine marketplace, and some from other sources like artstation. I wanted a way to easily view all the assets i have, with information on each of them. This is a react app that allows a user to add their assets either manually or import them from the unreal engine marketplace (i have plans to add more sources also) and view them all in a single place with all the information they need.

This is only the frontend, the [backend API](https://github.com/Puyodead1/asset-db-backend) is also required
